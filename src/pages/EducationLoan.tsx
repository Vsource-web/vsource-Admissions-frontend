                  A student loan is a form of financial aid that helps students
                  pay for higher education expenses, including tuition, fees,
                  books, and living costs. Unlike grants or scholarships, a loan
                  must be repaid, usually with interest. These loans can be a
                  critical tool for those who cannot afford college outright,
                  but it's essential to understand the terms and conditions.

                <p className="text-gray-600 md:text-base text-justify">
                  Choosing a student loan is a significant financial decision
                  that can affect your finances for years after graduation. It's
                  crucial to borrow only what you need and to explore all your
                  options, including scholarships, grants, and federal
                  work-study programs, before taking on debt. Once you have a
                  loan, managing it wisely is key.
